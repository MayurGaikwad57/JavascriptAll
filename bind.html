<!--  BIND IN JAVASCRIPT
The bind method in JavaScript is used to explicitly set the this context for a function,
ensuring it refers to the intended object regardless of how the function is called.
It was introduced to solve issues related to this in JavaScript,
especially in scenarios involving callbacks, event listeners, and object-oriented programming.
Here's a detailed explanation, including the history, evolution, and modern usage, along with an analysis of your provided example.

Historical Context of this
In JavaScript, the value of this is determined by how a function is called:
In a global context, this refers to the global object (window in browsers).
In a method call on an object, this refers to the object invoking the method.
In event listeners or callbacks, this can change depending on the calling context, often leading to confusion.
The introduction of the bind method aimed to address these issues by providing a way to set this explicitly.
