    // Concept of closure 
/*  Javascript behind the scenes work
store values in memory 
return those values when requested , also all of its working is through 
single thread only 
#### Closures in Javascript 
1) When we are actually returning a function which is inside anothere function 
lets say main() parent and sub() as child 
so when we return reference of sub() i.e child function and execute the main function
according to the thoery the main() function be removed from stack after execution
But , when the main parent is getting executed the child functions reference is 
also returned so when this child function is stored in the memory 
it's lexical scope i.e main function is also stored in the memory as a result 
of which in console you can see output as Mayur

SO , IN SHORT WHEN YOU RETURN A FUNCTION , NOT ONLY THAT FUNCTION IS RETURNED 
BUT ITS LEXICAL SCOPE IS ALSO RETURNED 

*/
    function main() {
        let name = "Mayur"
        function sub() {
            console.log(name)
        }
        return sub;
    }
    const myFunc = main()
    myFunc();

    // Practical Example of Lexical Scoping and closure 
  function color(colors) {
   return function getColors() {
    // Here getColors() has access of all the properties of 
    // function color so you can see we have imjected 
    // variable colors and access to colors is simply because of 
    // concept of lexical scope 
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = `${colors}`
}
  }
  document.getElementById('orange').onclick = color('orange')
  /* Here OnClick expects a function in our case color() is a function 
  but if we directly execute a method without returning from it 
  we wont get expected results 
  why ?? 
  1) whenever you use any event such as onClick() it expects a function 
  from you to perform the intended operation as needed
  but instead of returning a value from the function you are simply
  executing the function directly 
  ex->  function color(colors) {
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = `${colors}`
  }  
     document.getElementById('orange').onclick = color('orange')    
     wont work because you are not retruning anything , just plainly executing 
     the function which is wrong 
     
     so what we do is create anothere fucntion inside color and return the function 
     which will indeed return us whatever actions that function is performing
    
     function color(colors) {
         return function() {
          document.body.style.backgroundColor = `${colors}`
          and how we have access of this colors because of lexical scoping 
          i.e child functions can access properties from the parent function
         }
      }
