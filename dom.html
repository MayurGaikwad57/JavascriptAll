<!-- Important Concept In Node Selectors in Javascript 
 1) innerText -> displays only innerText  which is visisble on our web page so that we can manipulate only that text
 2) textContent -> display content which is even hidden but present with that id element 
   like this text may not been displayed on our web page but present with that id 
   // to select and manipulate such examples we have textContent
3) innerHTML -> displays the present and hidden text from the element with html tags 
// provides enhanced understanding of the elements text and html it carries
-->

<!--  2nd Important Concept with css selectors 
  1) Query Selector 
    1.1)document.querySelector('#id') -> to get the entire html element with matching id
    1.2)document.queryselector('.className') -> to get the entire html matching with class Name 
    1.3)document.queryselector('input[type=password]') -> to access html element whose input type is password 
    1.4) If the html doesnt has id or class you can pass that element tag directly inside querySelector
         document.querySelector('ul') -> targeting ul as it has no id or class
  // Similarly you can use queryselector to target and get the dom elements 
  // It is wholly and solley based on your css abilities how you target the elements
  2) Important part querySelectorAll 
    querySelectorAll returns Node List 
    2.1) Imp Discussion 
    2.2) a) Node list is not same as Array 
         b) In nodeList Prototype you get only forEach() array method
         const ulList = document.querySelectorAll('li') 
         Note-> to access the dom and manipulate it you cannot do in same way as of querySelector and getElementById 
         remember we are returning NodeList 
         // follow the below method to access the dom 
         ullist[0].style.backgroundColor = "green"  -> to select the first element from the list
         // by changing the number from 0 to index of element you want to manipulate

         ulList.forEach((l)=>{
          l.style.color = "red" 
           })

<!-- 3rd Important concept in Javascript Node seelectors 
 KEY POINT -> 1)When you target the DOM by ClassName then you get HTMLCollection 
 which is similar to Array but not an Array 
2) To apply the array methods you have to first convert it into an array 
After that you can successfully apply our array methods to it 
    example  -> lets say you want to color the elements of html to red 
  steps-) 1.1) First we will target the dom element by className 
NOTE -> In Html we have class and use that but behind the scenes the browser interprets it as a className 

let getElement = document.getElementsByClassName('homeLander') 
 getElement -> varaible that holds the dom element
 getElementByClassName -> to target element based on className
 ('homeLander') is the class name inside curly braces
 conosle.log(getElement) 
 // output HTMlCollection which includes all the targeted class elements 

 //......Now we have to convert it into an array 
 let holdConvertArray = Array.from(getElement)
 // here dont put that HTMLCollection inside a string keep it as it is 
 console.log(holdConvertArray) // outputs as an array

 Now we will manipulate that dom 
 let addColor = holdConvertArray.forEach((val)=>{
      val.style.color = "red"
 })

 succesfully manipulated the DOM element by targeting it using a class and converting HTMLCollection to Array
